Up supports a number of interpreted languages, and virtually any language which can be compiled to a binary such as Golang. Up does its best to provide idiomatic and useful out-of-the-box experiences tailored to each language. Currently first-class support is provided for:

- Golang
- Node.js
- Crystal
- Static sites

## Node.js

When a `package.json` file is detected, Node.js is the assumed runtime. By default `nodejs10.x` is used, see [Lambda Settings](https://apex.sh/docs/up/configuration/#lambda_settings) for details.

The `build` hook becomes:

```
$ npm run build
```

The server run by the proxy becomes:

```
$ npm start
```

## Golang

When a `main.go` file is detected, Golang is the assumed runtime.

The `build` hook becomes:

```
$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o server *.go
```

The `clean` hook becomes:

```
$ rm server
```

## Crystal

When a `main.cr` file is detected, Crystal is the assumed runtime. Note that this runtime requires Docker to be installed.

The `build` hook becomes:

```
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -w /src crystallang/crystal crystal build -o server main.cr --release --static
```

The `clean` hook becomes:

```
$ rm server
```

## Static

When an `index.html` file is detected the project is assumed to be static.
